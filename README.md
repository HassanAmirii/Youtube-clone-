# YouTube Clone Project ðŸŽ¥

## Overview

This repository contains a **YouTube clone** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The project is part of my journey to revisit and strengthen my front-end development skills.

Additionally, the repository includes **practice files** used to explore concepts like:

- Flexbox
- Grid
- Basic layouts

## Features

- Responsive layout (in progress)
- Clean, structured HTML
- Styling with CSS

## Folder Structure

- `/youtube-clone`: Main project files (HTML, CSS, and assets)
- `/practice-files`: Experiments and learning exercises

## What Iâ€™m Learning

- Building layouts from scratch
- Understanding CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Improving code organization

## Future Goals

- Add interactivity with JavaScript
- Make the design fully responsive

## How to View

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HassanAmirii/Youtube-clone-.git
